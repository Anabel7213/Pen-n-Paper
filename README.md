## Pen&Paper

This project is a redo of one I created a few months ago when my scope was limited to HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It was a typical messy beginner code. Today, I carry a significantly broader reservoir of knowledge with me, and it hurts me every time I look at that code but I guess it was part of the process to get where I am now.

The improved Pen&Paper is a total makeover in terms of code structure and user experience. It's now sleeker and faster. The frontend is powered by React and Tailwind CSS, while the backend relies on Next.js and asynchronous JavaScript with axios for processing API requests.

You can choose between dark, light, and system themes. The project utilizes free APIs like myMemory for translation and XF API for English word definitions. Just note that the data from these APIs might occasionally be incomplete.
